Before editing your in game settings, make sure your game user settings in the local app data is turned off, so it wont revert back and ruin the preset. you may turn
it back on after you set your settings. 

Preset is intended to be used while on Gamma 2.2/2.4 otherwise it'll override the adjustments

 Anti-Aliasing should also be turned off, use XESS Mode instead and set to preference. I use Balanced

drag the lut file in the textures folder on your reshade.

to find that folder in your egs (where all the reshades are stored) go to the reshade-shaders folder, textures should be here. then replace that base lut with the lut 
I baked here. Enjoy!
