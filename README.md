Thanks for downloading my Reshade preset! I hope you enjoy it :D

to install it you first wanna install Reshade, select direct x 11 and make sure to check the boxes for these shaders

-SweetFx by CeeJay
-Color Effects by Prod80

once these shaders and Reshade is installed you want to either launch the game and press the home button on your keyboard to bring open the menu

skip the tutorial cuz reading is lame, click the folder icon next to the drop down menu. and then drag the preset into this folder.

or you can go to where your game is currently installed and go to these folders here

\DeadByDaylight\DeadByDaylight\Binaries\EGS

then drag the ini file here

and thats it.
